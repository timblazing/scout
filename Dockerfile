# This is the same choice the systemd service makes, and for the same reason:
# nmap needs raw sockets to read the ARP table, which is what supplies MAC
# addresses and manufacturer names, and port 291 is privileged. Capabilities
# granted with cap_add land in the permitted set but never become effective for
# a process that starts as a non-root user, so running unprivileged here meant
# the container could neither bind its port nor identify a single device.
#
# The container itself remains the isolation boundary.
